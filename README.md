Concepts Covered
1. Data Types and Variables
Primitive types: Strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, null, and symbols.
Reference types: Objects and arrays.
Example of using typeof to check data types.
2. Variables: Let, Const, and Var
Explanation of variable scoping using var, let, and const.
Differences in scoping behavior inside functions and blocks.
3. Changing HTML Content
Use of JavaScript to modify HTML content dynamically with getElementById and innerHTML.
Examples of interacting with the DOM (Document Object Model).
4. Working with Arrays
Array methods: .map(), .filter(), and .reduce().
Demonstrations of looping over arrays and modifying elements.
5. Functions and Closures
Definition and use of closures to maintain state between function calls.
Explanation of immediately invoked function expressions (IIFE).
6. Higher-Order Functions
Functions that accept other functions as arguments (e.g., for callbacks).
Examples using basic math functions for addition and multiplication.
7. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Creating classes and inheriting from parent classes using extends and super.
Example with a Dog class inheriting from an Animal class.
8. Promises and Async/Await
Demonstration of how to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript using Promises.
async and await for cleaner asynchronous code.
9. Symbols and Iterators
Explanation of Symbol and how to use it for custom iterators.
Example of iterating over an object using the Symbol.iterator.
10. DOM Manipulation
Creating and appending elements dynamically to the DOM.
Changing styles and handling user input via forms.
